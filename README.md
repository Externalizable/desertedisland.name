Plan your island getaway and pick the perfect island name from a variety of categories! https://desertedisland.name

## About
[Animal Crossing: New Horizons](http://www.animal-crossing.com/new-horizons) will allow players to name their very own island. In the prequels, this task was often described as difficult. Until the release of Animal Crossing: New Horizons, players will hopefully be able to find inspiration from this Deserted Island Name Generator!

Generates island names from a variety of sources, such as Nintendo games and fruits.

## Name Sources (Categories)
You can submit more name sources! Please keep the sources [PG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_Picture_Association_of_America_film_rating_system#MPAA_film_ratings) and use common sense when submitting a new list of names.

1. [Fork the repository](https://github.com/Externalizable/desertedisland.name/fork)
2. Add a `.txt` file in `/names/`
3. Fill your `.txt` file with as many names as your category serves
4. Add your `.txt` file name to of the `files` array in `core.js`, without the succeeding `.txt`
    * **Example:** Your `.txt` file is `Pokemon SwSh.txt`, which means you want to insert `"Pokemon SwSh",` into the array, ideally somewhere in the middle
5. [Submit a Pull Request](https://github.com/Externalizable/desertedisland.name/pulls), and don't forget to describe your category!
